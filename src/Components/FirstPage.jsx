            Point of Sales (POS) is a platform where Customer and Distributer/Retailer can interact with each other. Transaction is performed between a Distributer and customer when a product or service is purchased, by commonly using Point of Sales system to complete the transaction.  Apart from Transaction, POS also provide sales, inventory and customer management. Thatâ€™s why most of the Business units start using POS instead using Traditional Methods like Manual methods, cash registers, Excel for book-keeping.
